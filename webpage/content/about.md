## LEPISZCZE
LEPISZCZE is an open-source benchmark and a continuous-submission leaderboard, concentrating public Polish datasets (existing and new) in speciﬁc tasks. 
Integrating datasets and tasks with model performance and efﬁciency allows academia and industry to gauge performance on tasks of interest quickly. Finally, it intends to foster constructive competition and innovation by bringing together and promoting previously disparate resources.
